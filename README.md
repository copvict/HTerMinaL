# HTerMinaL

A Command Line Interface-like snippet. Just as light as JavaScript, and as easy as HTML to implement.

## Scope

Unix/Linux enthusiasts can use HTerMinaL to show their love for CLI in their personal websites.

## Future Improvements

1. Implement functionality for basic commands such as "help", "ls", and "cd" to emulate the CLI experience.
2. User input to navigate through a website. 
3. HackerMode: Random user keystrokes will dump program from a input file.
